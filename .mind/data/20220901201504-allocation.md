# allocation

## Memory usage
- With the starts/ends of the linear scan, I'm currently going to allocate a new
slice and fill it to get just the indices. But when I insert an arena allocator
in there, doing that will waste even more space. So it will be smart to re-use
half of the already allocated data to store the new stuff.
